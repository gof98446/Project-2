# Project Description: 
This project uses public transit data from New York City to explore MTA ridership recovery trends from 2020 to 2025. By visualizing changes in ridership across subway, bus, commuter rail, and paratransit services, we assess how different transportation modes have rebounded from the COVID-19 pandemic. The analysis highlights significant gaps in recovery, particularly among services relied on by vulnerable populations. It offers insights into the economic, social, and policy implications of transit usage in a post-pandemic world.

The project focuses on seven key MTA transportation modes: Subways, Buses, LIRR, Metro-North, Access-A-Ride, Bridges and Tunnels, and the Staten Island Railway, addressing two main questions:

How have MTA subway and bus ridership recovered compared to pre-pandemic levels?

Which transportation mode has had the slowest recovery post-COVID, and how does it compare to others over time?

Using Tableau for analysis, we created trendline visualizations comparing each mode’s annual recovery as a percentage of its pre-pandemic baseline. Findings show that while Bridges and Tunnels quickly surpassed pre-2020 levels, modes such as Access-A-Ride and the Staten Island Railway remain significantly below full recovery. These results emphasize the need for informed transit policy, equitable investment, and targeted support for underserved communities.
# Data Manipulations: 
To support our objective of analyzing MTA ridership recovery from 2020 to 2025, we performed several key data manipulations in Tableau. We filtered the dataset to focus only on relevant fields, specifically recovery percentages and estimated ridership by mode and date. The data was grouped by weekday to identify patterns in daily usage and by year to measure recovery trends over time. For the line chart, we calculated average yearly recovery rates for each transportation mode relative to their pre-pandemic baselines. For the heatmap, we computed the average daily ridership by weekday to reveal which days had the highest engagement for each mode. These transformations allowed us to build clear and focused visualizations that directly answer our research questions and highlight key usage and equity trends within New York City’s transit system.
# Analysis #1:
This heat map visualizes average MTA ridership by day of the week across all transportation modes. It reveals that Tuesday through Thursday consistently see the highest ridership, especially for subways and buses, highlighting strong commuter patterns. LIRR and Metro-North show significantly lower weekend usage, reinforcing their role as weekday commuter rails. The visualization helps identify trends that can guide resource allocation and service planning, such as reducing frequency on lower-ridership days like weekends.

# Analysis #2:
This line chart tracks ridership recovery across seven MTA transportation modes from 2020 to 2025, measuring progress relative to pre-pandemic levels. Access-A-Ride and the Staten Island Railway had the slowest recovery, remaining below 80% by 2025. In contrast, Bridges and Tunnels recovered fastest, surpassing 100% as early as 2022. LIRR and Metro-North also rebounded strongly, while subways and buses showed steady but incomplete recovery, reaching approximately 85% and 54% respectively. The visualization highlights significant variation in recovery, reflecting differences in usage patterns, commuter behavior, and service reliance.

# Deeper Look:
1. Economic
   
Ridership directly impacts fare revenue, which helps fund operations, maintain service quality, and support transit jobs. A slow recovery can strain the MTA’s budget, leading to reduced services, higher fares, or funding shortfalls.

2. Social
   
Public transit is essential for many low-income, elderly, and non-driving New Yorkers. Uneven recovery across modes can limit access to work, healthcare, and daily needs, raising concerns about equity and transit reliability.

3. Policy
   
Understanding which modes are recovering slowly helps policymakers prioritize resources, improve accessibility, and plan long-term transit strategies that address infrastructure needs and rider support.
